  <title>Systems of linear equations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Computing and studying solutions to equations, and <em>systems of equations</em>, unquestionably plays an important role in mathematics; though we hasten to add that this is not all that mathematicians do! In this chapter we will develop an essentially complete theory of a particularly simple family of mathematical equations: namely, <em>linear equations</em>.  This will serve as a somewhat indirect introduction to our study of linear algebra, as lurking below our parametric descriptions of solutions to linear systems lie vector space notions like subspace, span, and linear independence. Furthermore, we will introduce one of the most important computational tools of linear algebra: <xref ref="d_GE" text="custom">Gaussian elimination</xref>.

        A <term>linear expression</term> in the <m>n</m> unknowns
        (or variables)
        <m>x_1,x_2,\dots x_n</m> is an expression of the form
        <me>
          a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots +a_nx_n
        </me>,
        where <m>a_1,a_2,\dots, a_n</m> are fixed real numbers.
      </p>
      <p>A <term>linear equation</term> in the unknowns <m>x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n</m> is an equation that can be simplified, using only addition and subtraction, to an equation of the form
        <men xml:id="eq_std_form">
          a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots a_nx_n=b,
        </men>
        which we call its <term>standard form </term>. An equation in the unknowns <m>x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n</m> is <term>nonlinear</term> if it cannot be simplified to the form <xref ref="eq_std_form"/> using only addition and subtraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given a linear equation with standard form <xref ref="eq_std_form"/>, the equation is called <term>homogeneous</term> if <m>b=0</m>, and <term>nonhomogeneous</term> if <m>b\ne 0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>

    <title>Linear and nonlinear equations</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Consider <m>\sqrt{3}x+\sin(5)=2z-e^4y</m>.
            This is a linear equation in the unknowns <m>x,y,z</m>. Its standard form is <m>\sqrt{3}x+e^4y-2z=-\sin(5)</m>.
            Since the right-hand side is nonzero, we see that the equation is nonhomogeneous.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The equation <m>x^2+y^2=1</m> is a nonlinear
            equation in the unknowns <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The equation 
            <me>
              \frac{3}{x+2y+z}=1
            </me>
            is nonlinear. Interestingly, however, the set of solutions to this equation is equal to the set of solutions to the linear equation 
            <me>
              x+2y+z=3
            </me>.
            This illustrates that <xref ref="d_lin-equation"/> is concerned strictly with the form of an equation, and not with the solutions to that equation.

    We next provide a precise definition of a solution of a linear equation. This definition will involve <m>n</m>-tuples <m>(s_1,s_2,\dots, s_n)</m> of real numbers. Tuples are treated in more detail in <xref ref="s_tuples"/>. In short, as defined in <xref ref="d_tuple"/>, an <m>n</m>-tuple is an <em>ordered sequence</em> of elements. The defining property of tuples is that they are ordered objects, as opposed to unordered. This is captured by the notion of equality between tuples: we have 
    <me>
      (s_1,s_2,\dots, s_n)=(t_1,t_2,\dots, t_n)
    </me>
    if and only if <m>s_i=t_i</m> for all <m>1\leq i\leq n</m>.

    As you may recall, a (nontrivial) linear equation in two unknowns defines a line in <m>\R^2</m>, and a (nontrivial) equation in three unknowns defines a plane in <m>\R^3</m>. These types of subsets (of <m>\R^2</m> and <m>\R^3</m>, respectively) have distinctive geometric properties that we will elucidate in coming sections. Generalizing this notion to an arbitrary number of unknowns leads to the notion of a <em>hyperplane</em>.

    <title>Visualizing planes in <m>\R^3</m></title>
    <p>
      Let <m>\mathcal{P}\subseteq \R^3</m> be a plane defined by the nontrivial equation 
      <men xml:id="eq_vis_plane">
        ax+by+cz=d

      Later in the course we will describe an alternative approach to visualizing <m>\mathcal{P}</m> in terms of its <q>normal vector</q> <m>\boldn=(a,b,c)</m>. For now we recall a more elementary approach. Namely, simply find by insepction three <em>non-colinear</em> points <m>P,Q,R</m> satisfying <xref ref="eq_vis_plane"/>, sketch the triangle in <m>\R^3</m> they define, and then envision <m>\mathcal{P}</m> as the plane in <m>\R^3</m> containing this triangle. In practice we can find three such points by picking arbitrary values for two of the three variables, and solving for the third variable using <xref ref="eq_vis_plane"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if <m>\mathcal{P}</m> is the plane with equation <m>x+y+z=2</m>, we see easily that <m>P=(2,0,0), Q=(0,2,0), R=(0,0,2)</m> lie on <m>\mathcal{P}</m>, allowing us to produce the graph in <xref ref="fig_visualize_plane"/>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As with lines, it is easy to see that the equation <xref ref="eq_vis_plane"/> defining <m>\mathcal{P}</m> is homogeneous if and only if <m>\mathcal{P}</m> passes through the origin <m>(0,0,0)</m>.

          The solution set is empty; i.e., there are no solutions.

          Solving for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>t</m> we get
          <m>(x,y)=(t,t-1)</m> for any <m>t\in\R</m>,
          and thus <m>S=\{(t,t-1)\colon t\in\R\}</m>, an infinite set!

  For each system in <xref ref="s_systems_eg_2eqns2varss"/>, use a geometric argument to determine <em>how many</em> solutions there are.  
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
  <p>
    We proceed geometrically by observing that each equation in a given system defines a line, that a pair <m>(x,y)</m> is a solution to the given equation if and only if it is a point on the corresponding line, and thus that a pair <m>(x,y)</m> is a solution to both equations if and only if it is a point lying on both lines. Thus, geometrically speaking, the set of solutions to a given system is equal to the intersection of the two corresponding lines. 
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          In this case the two lines <m>\ell_1\colon x-y=0</m> and <m>\ell_2\colon x-y=1</m> are parallel (and not equal to one another). It follows that their intersection is empty. We conclude that there are no solutions to the system. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In this case the two lines <m>\ell_1\colon x-y=0</m> and <m>\ell_2\colon x+y=1</m> are nonparallel. It follows that they intersect in a single point. We conclude that the system has a unique solution.  
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In this case the two equations <m>x-y=1</m> and <m>2x-2y=2</m> define the same line <m>\ell</m>, and thus that their intersection is also equal to <m>\ell</m>. The set of solutions to the system is then equal to the set of points of <m>\ell</m>, which is infinite.

  In <xref ref="s_systems_eg_2eqns2varss"/> we were able to combine some simple logic and arithmetic to solve each system completely.  Of course, things get more complicated as the number of equations and/or unknowns in the system increases.
</p>
<p>
  For example, consider the system
    <men xml:id="s_systems_eq_runningexample">
      \begin{linsys}{3} 2x\amp -\amp y\amp -\amp z\amp =\amp 3\\ x\amp \amp \amp -\amp z\amp =\amp 2 \\ x\amp -\amp y\amp \amp \amp =\amp 1 \end{linsys}
    </men>
  Observe first that the triple <m>(5,2,5)</m> is not a solution to the system; one easily checks that is satisfies the first and second equations, but not the third. Similarly, it is easy to verify that <m>(4,2,3)</m> and <m>(0,-1,2)</m> are both solutions to the system. The question remains: How do we find <em>all</em> solutions to the linear system in a systematic way?
</p>
<remark>
  <p>Notice the somewhat funny spacing in <xref ref="s_systems_eq_runningexample"/>. This is in force in order to align the unknowns in separate columns. In general, when handed a linear system in the wild, your first step should be to write each equation in standard form, and make sure the unknowns are aligned vertically in this manner.

  The staircase pattern of <m>L'</m> allows us to solve easily by
    <em>backwards substitution</em>. In more detail:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Equation 3 in <m>L'</m> tells us that <m>z=2</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
      Now substitute <m>z=2</m> into Equation 2 of <m>L'</m> and solve for <m>y</m> to get <m>y=4</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
      Finally, substitute <m>y=4</m> and <m>z=2</m> into Equation 1 of <m>L'</m>and solve for <m>x</m> to get <m>x=4</m>.
      We conclude that <m>(x,y,z)=(4,4,2)</m> is a solution to <m>L'</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Furthermore, since at each step we had no choice in the matter (<m>z</m> must be equal to 2, <m>y</m> then must be equal to 4, etc.), we see that in fact <m>(4,4,2)</m> is the <em>only</em> solution to <m>L'</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
    Our method for solving a more complicated system,

    it to a simpler system like <m>L'</m>.

    <p>
      After reducing a linear system <m>L</m> using elementary operations, we are left with a new system <m>L'</m>. The systems <m>L</m> and <m>L'</m> will generally look very different from one another. Note, however, that the two systems will have the same <em>number</em> of equations, and the same <em>number</em> of variables. More importantly, the two systems will have identical sets of solutions; that is, the set of solutions of the new system <m>L'</m> is identical to the set of solutions to <m>L</m>!
    </p>
    <p> To convince ourselves of this last assertion, it suffices to show that the application of any one of these elementary row operations produces a new system <m>L'</m> with exactly the same set of solutions as <m>L</m>; if this is so, then performing any finite sequence of elementary row operations must also preserve the set of solutions in this sense. <xref ref="s_systems_th_rowops"/> makes this argument official. First we introduce the notion of <em>equivalent linear systems</em>, mainly to spare ourselves from the mouthful that is <q>obtained by applying a finite sequence of elementary row operations</q>.
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="d_rowequivalent">
    <title>Row equivalent linear systems</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We say two systems of linear equations are

        if the one can be obtained from the other by a finite sequence of elementary operations.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Row equivalent systems of linear equations have identical sets of solutions.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We prove by induction that if system <m>L'</m> is the result of applying <m>n</m> elementary operations to system <m>L</m>, <m>n\geq 0</m>, then <m>L</m> and <m>L'</m> have the same set of solutions.
      </p>
      <case>
        <title> Base case: <m>n=0</m></title>
        <p>
          In this case <m>L=L'</m> (we have applied no operations) and the statement is obvious.
        </p>
      </case>
      <case>
        <title>Induction step</title>
        <p>Assume that applying a sequence of <m>n</m> elementary operations to a linear system preserves the set of solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>L'</m> is the result of applying <m>n+1</m> elementary operations to the system <m>L</m>. Let <m>L''</m> be the result of applying the first <m>n</m> of these operations. By the induction hypothesis, systems <m>L</m> and <m>L''</m> have the same set of solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the system <m>L'</m> is obtained from <m>L''</m> by applying exactly one elementary operation, it now suffices to show that applying a single row operation does not change the set of solutions to a linear system. This is the result of <xref ref="ex_row_ops_preserve"/>. (Note that a solution is provided to that exercise.)
      </p>
      <p>
        We conclude that <m>L</m> and <m>L'</m> have the same set of solutions, as desired.

  You may be tempted to do multiple operations in a single step during this procedure. Resist this temptation for now until we have a better understanding of things.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, if later on you do give in to this temptation, make sure that the two (or more row operations) you perform are independent of one another. For example, do not swap <m>e_2</m> with <m>e_1</m> and replace <m>e_3</m> with <m>e_3-5e_2</m> in the same step.
