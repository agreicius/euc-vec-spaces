</h4> <div class="para">Wouldn’t it have been more natural to simply say <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is infinite dimensional if it has an infinite basis? That way we could dispense with the cases of <a href="s_dimension.html#d_dimension" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/d_dimension.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Definition 4.4.2: Dimension of a vector space">Definition 4.4.2</a> and simply define <span class="process-math">\(\dim V\)</span> as the cardinality of any basis of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> As it turns out, our defined notion of having infinite dimension is indeed equivalent to not having a finite basis, but to prove this we need to establish the general fact that every vector space has a basis. As intuitive as that claim may sound (i.e., that bases always exist), its proof requires some set theory methods that are not covered in this text. As such we will not include it in our treatment of dimension, and so will have to make do with our slightly awkward definition of infinite-dimensional vector spaces.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="s_dimension.html#rm_basis_existence">in-context</a></span>
