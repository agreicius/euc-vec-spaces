<div class="para">We proceed geometrically by observing that each equation in a given system defines a line, that a pair <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> is a solution to the given equation if and only if it is a point on the corresponding line, and thus that a pair <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> is a solution to both equations if and only if it is a point lying on both lines. Thus, geometrically speaking, the set of solutions to a given system is equal to the intersection of the two corresponding lines.</div>
